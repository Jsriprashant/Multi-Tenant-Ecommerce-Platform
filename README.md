# Multi-Tenant Application

A real multi-tenant e-commerce app where creators have their own storefronts, sell digital products, and get paid through Stripe Connect.  
Features include subdomains for each creator, product reviews, personal libraries for buyers, secure file delivery, and automatic platform fees.  
The platform also provides an admin dashboard with role-based access control.  
Built with **Next.js 15**, **Payload CMS**, and **Stripe**‚Äîthis project is a practical, modern example of how to build scalable SaaS platforms with all the essentials.

|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Next.js**                         | Modern React framework for fast, scalable web apps.                                                         |
| **Payload CMS**                      | Powerful headless CMS for managing all app data, with built-in admin UI and authentication.                 |
| **@payloadcms/plugin-multi-tenant**  | Adds true multi-tenancy to Payload, so each tenant's data is isolated and secure.                           |
| **tRPC**                            | End-to-end type-safe APIs‚Äîno need to write API schemas or types twice.                                      |
| **nuqs**                            | Syncs React state with URL query params, making filters/shareable URLs easy.                                |
| **Zod**                             | TypeScript-first schema validation for API inputs and forms.                                                |
| **React Query**                     | Handles data fetching, caching, and pagination for a smooth user experience.                                |

**How this is better than traditional approaches:**  
- No more writing REST endpoints and types separately‚ÄîtRPC keeps everything in sync.
- Payload CMS gives you a ready-to-use admin panel and authentication out of the box.
- Multi-tenant plugin means you don't have to manually separate tenant data.
- nuqs makes filter/search state shareable via URLs, with almost no code.
